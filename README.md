# 3D-Renderer-Old
This is the first version of a 3D renderer I made in python

This verion I made 2 years before the more recent version which you can find at
https://github.com/Cakey25/Rendering-Visualisation. This version does not at all use the GPU and 
does all rendering with pygame and due to this does look much more polished than the newer version.
This version is also made with OOP as that is what I was using at the time so the code will look very
different to the other verision. Another thing to note is that I did not perfectly under stand all the maths
when making this version so there are some things which are uneccessary or created from trial and error so
for code that clearly shows how the maths is done, you should refer to the newer version.

This is how the project looks:

To run the project run main.py, the only dependancies are pygame and numpy.
To moove around you can use w,a,s,d and you the mouse to rotate the camera around.
You can move vertically up using the the space bar which will cause you to just up (you cannot got below a set y-value).
